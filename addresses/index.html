		<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto my-2 img-quater" src="../img/plen/openf.png" alt="opening"/>
        <p>
			The early 21st century has seen migration on an unprecedented scale since the second world war. Now, as many migrants begin to find themselves at their destinations, Western Nations find themselves with hundreds thousands of new inhabitants in their lands that they are responsible for. What does the future hold for these newly settled migrants? How will politics be affected by their presence? Should society absorb these new migrants, or should these migrants focus on preserving their own culture?

		<p>
			Ahmed Hussen is the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship for the Government of Canada, as well as a Member of Parliament for the riding of York South-Weston. Born and raised in Somalia, Hussen immigrated to Canada in 1993 where he settled in Regent Park and quickly gravitated towards public service. Before his entry into politics, Hussen practised Immigration, Criminal, Refugee, and Human Rights Law in Toronto. He was presented with the RBC Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Award, an award that honours the achievements of immigrants who have chosen to make Canada their home. The Toronto Star named him among the 10 individuals who have made significant contributions to Toronto in various fields, including community service, business, sports and science. He has continued his work in public service through his role as Minister of Immigration by creating new policies to help welcome more immigrants and refugees to Canada.
