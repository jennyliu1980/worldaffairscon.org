						<h1>Data Datcare</h1>

						<p class="card-text">
							<p>We are currently living in the “age of data”, where everything that surrounds us is linked to a data source and everything in our lives is captured digitally. The physical world around us has turned into raw information: internet, video, call data records, customer transactions, healthcare records, etc. 

              We like to call it big data—and it is indeed getting bigger, growing exponentially with each passing day. Luckily, the opportunities to take this data and combine it with analytics to improve all aspects of our lives are also growing exponentially.

              The increasing prevalence of big data, however, draws questions and controversy about the safety of our own personal data, with tremendous potential to be exploited with wide-ranging consequences.
            </p>

          <p>But there are some questions we must ask, too. How is automation impacting various sectors of the economy, from those where jobs are being destroyed to those where jobs are being created. How can society handle such a shift? Do we have the right public policy imperatives, and the right social infrastructure, to handle such shifts? What is the right ethical framework to make decisions about the deployment of automation/AI?
          Our plenary prepares our generation - the first generation that will be fully immersed in this technology - for what we need to know to be prepared for the exponential increase of cryptocurrencies in the years to come.</p>
