						<h1>Businesses in COVID: Sink or Swim</h1>
						<p class="card-text">
							<p>
                The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted everyone. It has forced us all to adapt to a ‘new reality,’ one largely involving technology and isolation. Businesses are no exception to this impact. Our plenary’s main focus is on how various businesses have been impacted by the pandemic, what changes have been made due to COVID, and what influence the epidemic will have on businesses in the future.
