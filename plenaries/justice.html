						<h1>Social Justice: Our History and Future</h1>
						<p class="card-text">
							<p>
                2020 has been a year of change in many ways. One of those major changes being the social justice movements that have occurred throughout the course of the year, a prominent one being the Black Lives Matter movement. This movement initiated change and awareness, but it still continues. We aim to educate high school students around the globe about the history of the Black Lives Matter movement, current and recent developments of BLM and the outcomes of the recent events. As we move towards a brighter future of anti-racism, there is pressure on the next generation to carry this movement forward.
                            </p>

In production since December of 2006, “Project T Dot” is currently scheduled for a late 2022 publication date.
            <br>
            Ajani is also a public speaker and a journalist for publications such as Thrive Global — an American company that provides behavior change technology and media to support individuals struggling with stress and burnout, and he counts among his many and varied commercial clients H&M, Universal Music Group, Bridgestone, Christian Dior, Calm, and the UFC. His work has been featured in publications such as Complex, Jay-Z’s Life + Times, and Vogue.

            Furthermore, he has worked with numerous icons and public figures in various capacities, including the likes of Arianna Huffington, Drake, The Weeknd, Pharrell Williams, the Wu-Tang Clan, Janelle Monáe, Snoop Dogg, Nas, Slash, Kanye West, Akon, Gene Simmons, Spike Lee, Director X, Dana White, and Commander Chris Hadfiel.
            <br>
            In his plenary, Ajani will use his expertise in art, social justice, and mental health to help students around the world better appreciate themselves and, in turn, others.
