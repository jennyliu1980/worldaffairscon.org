                <p>The plenary of Reconciliation and Indigenization is meant to discuss about conflict left with
                    Indigenous peoples over from the past of Canada’s colonial history. It should be recognized and
                    accepted the reality of Canadian history, accepted how that history paralyzed Indigenous Peoples,
                    and how it continues to subjugate Indigenous Peoples. Furthermore, the plenary will show a mass
                    discussion on reconciliation and the future of it within the upcoming decade.
                </p>

                <p>But there are some questions we must ask, too. What is the role of Canadian society in Truth and
                    Reconciliation? How have attitudes about the Indigenous changed since the abolishment of residential
                    schools? What is the future relationship between the government of Canada and Indigenous communities
                    in decade?
