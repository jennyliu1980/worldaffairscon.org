        <p class = "text-center">
            In the wake of Donald Trump's controversial decision to assassinate General Qassim Soleimani, Mehdi Hasan analyzes the ongoing tensions between the United Stated of America and the Republic of Iran, unpacks the history behind the fraught relations between the two countries, and offers his own solutions for ending four decades of enmity.

      <p>
        Mehdi Hasan is an award-winning journalist, political commentator, senior contributor at The Intercept, host of the podcast Deconstructed, as well as a presenter for Al Jazeera English. He is known globally for his televised takedowns of world leaders and political proxies. As a British, Muslim immigrant based in Donald Trump's Washington D.C., Mehdi offers a provocative perspective on the ups and downs of global politics and world affairs. At a time when the truth is being denied to the world, in the midst of chaos, moral failure, and when everything seems out of WAC, Mehdi exemplifies tenacity and courage in countering the myths and snowballing used by opponents of transparency, pluralism and democracy.

          Poet, novelist, playwright, and critic Dr. George Elliott Clarke was born near Windsor, Nova Scotia, and grew up in Halifax. He earned his BA from the University of Waterloo, MA from Dalhousie University, and Ph.D. from Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. Dr. Clarke is the recipient of many honors for his work, including numerous honorary doctorates; a Doctor of Law (LL.D) from Dalhousie University, and 3 Doctors of Letters from the University of New Brunswick, the University of Alberta, and Saint Mary’s University.  
          <br><br>
          He is the author of numerous collections of poetry including Saltwater Spirituals and Deeper Blues (1983), Lush Dreams, Blue Exile: Fugitive Poems 1978-2993 (1994), Execution Poems: The Black Acadian Tragedy of George and Rue (2001), which won the Governor General’s Literary Award, Illuminated Verses (2005), Black (2006), and the dramatic poem Trudeau: Long March, Shining Path (2007). Dr. Clarke’s work reflects his interests in the Black culture of Atlantic Canada, an experience and identity he has described as “Africadian.” He has explored the cultural and social histories of Black Canadians across various genres, frequently braiding together archival research and personal experience. He is the author of the verse-novel Whylah Falls (1990), which he later adapted for the radio and stage. Dr. Clarke has been instrumental in promoting the work of writers of African descent, especially those of Nova Scotia, publishing Odysseys Home: Mapping African-Canadian Literature in 2002.
          <br><br>
          Dr. Clarke has received many awards for his work over the years including the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Achievement Award, the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Fellowship Prize, the Planet Africa Renaissance Award, the Governor General’s Award for poetry, and the Eric Hoffer Book Award for Poetry. In 2006, Dr. Clarke was appointed to the Order of Nova Scotia and later appointed to the Order of Canada in 2008 at the rank Officer. In 2009, he was a co-recipient of the William P. Hubbard Award for Race Relations from the City of Toronto for his outstanding achievements and commitment in making a distinct difference in racial relations in Toronto. Dr. Clarke was chosen expressly for "his local and national leadership role in creating an understanding and awareness of African and black culture and excellence in his contribution to redefining culture." In November 2012, Dr. Clarke became Toronto’s fourth Poet Laureate, and in 2016, he became Canada’s seventh Parliamentary Poet Laureate.

        <p class="card-text">
          Six years ago, Edward Snowden gave the WAC 2015 Lionel Gelber Keynote Address. In June 2013, Snowden leaked highly classified information about the scale and scope of NSA and CIA counter-terrorism and counter-intelligence operations around the globe. Since then, he has become a household name and is among the most influential privacy activists in the world. At the Keynote Address, Snowden explained his views on global privacy issues, government involvement in citizens' lives, and the dangers of the digital age.
