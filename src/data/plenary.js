      text: 'As the global media environment continues to evolve with the times, its influence on people, societies, and governments is changing as well. The symbiotic relationship between media and politics constantly shifts in our current era of transparency and instant access. Without politics, the media would lose a significant purpose underlying its importance to society. Without the media, governments lose a critical source of information and medium for its messaging. However, the media also holds an important role in critiquing governments through articles, videos, and comedy, holding governments accountable for their policies and actions. The advent of ‘digital media’ continues to completely redefine the way governments make and communicate decisions. Please join us for an insightful fireside chat on the love-hate relationship between media and politics with the editor-in-chief of the Toronto Sun, Adrienne Batra.  Perspective-changing, popular political comedian Ismael Loutfi will also challenge our perceptions of these two critical components of society. ',
