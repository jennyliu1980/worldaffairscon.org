      title: 'Rethinking Sustainability: Innovations for the Environment',
      text: 'Since the 20th century, increased human activity has created a noticeable problem for the environment, effectively demolishing the natural world and threatening ecosystems. Through industrialization, overpopulation, deforestation, and overconsumption, overt changes have affected the environment, triggering climate change. Throughout the world, water has become undrinkable, burning fossil fuels has diminished air quality, and greenhouse gasses have concealed our atmosphere. Although human activity created these problems, can it be used to solve them? From recycling and waste management to global emissions monitoring using satellites, this plenary investigates how technology and innovation have yielded creative solutions to help redefine our methods to sustainability.',
