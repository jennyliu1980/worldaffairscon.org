## What's WAC?

The World Affairs Conference (WAC) is Canada's oldest annual student-run current affairs conference. Annually held at Upper Canada College in Toronto, Canada, the World Affairs Conference connects over 1000 students, with a common interest in current affairs, from across North America.

This year's theme, "Together Towards Tomorrow", focuses on the future of spaceflight, social media, social justice, and businesses. As young people, it is our responsibility to engage and strive to change the world around us for the better.
